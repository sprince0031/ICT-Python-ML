Hello and welcome back to Python and Machine Learning Foundations. In the last video, we learned the theory of how a neural network trains and the different steps involved in it.

Today, we're going to build two practical models from scratch using scikit-learn. An MLP Regressor to predict a continuous value, and an MLP Classifier to predict a class. And with our classifier, we will uncover one of the most common traps in machine learning and why 'accuracy' can be misleading sometimes.

First, let's build a regressor. It predicts continuous values like the price of a house or the temperature tomorrow. We will use the classic California Housing dataset already included in google colab.

Let's start by importing all the libraries we'll need for this video.

Great, now lets load our housing data, split it into features X and our target y and then create our training and testing sets.
